# Micro-Mouse

For this project, we built a small robot that can avoid obstacles using an Arduino Uno. We used three ultrasonic sensors to help the robot detect objects in front, on the left, and on the right. The robot moves using two DC motors, each connected to a separate wheel, and both are controlled by an H-bridge (L298N) motor driver. The other two wheels are connected together using a small iron stick to support balance and movement. All the components were mounted on a basic robot chassis and connected using jumper wires. The robot is powered by a 9V battery. We programmed it using the Arduino IDE, and it makes movement decisions based on the distance data from the sensors. Before assembling the physical robot, we tested the logic and functionality using Tinkercad Circuits. This setup allowed us to successfully build a simple obstacle-avoiding robot.
