# Khadra – WRO Future Engineers Project  
**Team Triobotics**

## Introduction  
This repository contains all engineering materials for our project **Khadra**, a self-driven vehicle model built by **Team Triobotics** to participate in the **WRO Future Engineers competition 2025**.  
Our main objective was to design, simulate, and implement a self-driving robotic vehicle that can navigate autonomously using sensors and control algorithms.

## Our Journey  
We started our project by working with microcontrollers and learning how to connect and use different sensors. After that, we focused on understanding the steering mechanism with a servo motor.  

In the beginning, we used **Tinkercad** to simulate all the electronic connections and test our code, which made it easier for us to safely try out circuits and Arduino programming. Once the simulations worked as expected, we moved on to building the physical robot.  

For the body, we used **3D printing**, based on this model:

Step by step, this process allowed us to bring together electronics, coding, and mechanical design into a working autonomous vehicle.
